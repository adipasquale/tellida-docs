# FAQ

## Can I use another payment provider than Stripe ?

It is not possible to use any other provider, because Tellida relies heavily on Stripe Plans feature.

Because we want to provide a unified experience on your whole website, it is not possible either to use a different payment provider for non-subscription products on your store. Tellida will effectively bypass the payment method you selected in your Shopify settings.

## How does it compare to ReCharge, Paywhirl, Bold Apps and such ?

* __fully integrated to Shopify__ : Most of the other apps will redirect users from your shop to their own website to do the checkout or to update their accounts. Tellida is the only one to provide a seamless native Shopify experience.

* __simpler__ : ReCharge, Paywhirl and Bold Recurring App all provide a plethora of options, customizations, settings etc ... Tellida is by design much simpler to use, because it relies on Shopify and Stripe existing features.

* __cheaper__ : Tellida has the lowest fees :
    - __Tellida : 0€/mo + 3% or 15€/mo + 1%__
    - BOLD recurring orders : 20$/mo + 1%
    - Recharge : 20$/mo + 1%
    - BOLD recurring memberships : from 10 to 300$ from 50 to 10k users
    - Paywhirl : 0$/mo + 3% or 49$/mo + 2% or 149$/mo + 1% or 249$/mo + 0.5%
    - Charge Rabbit : 0$/mo + 5% or 75$/mo + 3% or 250$/mo + 1%
